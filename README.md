## My process

I started building the HTML structure (including classes' names) and once a finished that, I continued with the Sass part. First, I organized the configurations of it and then I code the styles. Second, I began struggling with JavaScript which took me most of the time. I had to take a break when the code wasn't working and I didn't know how to make it work, so I asked for help in the Frontend Mentor Community Slack. While I waited for an answer I continued with the Responsive part. After a while, two nice persons replied to my request and they advised me about what they thought I needed to know to start solving the issue, which was very helpful. Finally, after long hours of trial and error I could finish the challenge.
